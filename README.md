hello-world
===========
Greetings.  I'm trained as an English major and as a lawyer, but currently am a petty bureaucrat for the state of Maryland's Medicaid program.  I have been an editor, an opera diva-in-training, a federal government attorney, a law firm associate, a state assistant attorney general, and now, a deputy director on the "client" agency side.
